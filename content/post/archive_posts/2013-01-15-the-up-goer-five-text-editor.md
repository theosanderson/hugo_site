When Randall Monroe released the amazing [Up-Goer Five comic][1], I was inspired to hack together a [customised editor][2] so that I could explain my own research in the limited vocabulary of the thousand most common words.

For me the most exciting bit about this was that I got an email from Mr. xkcd himself. It also became a bit of a science-communication craze. A lot of scientists got in on the action (some kind people have made a collection [here][3]).

The editor has featured in [The Guardian][4] (and [again][5]). More recently it&#8217;s even been used for [conference sessions][6], which are pretty fantastic. (The [9th talk][7] in that playlist is particularly excellent). It&#8217;s also quite popular as a science communication training exercise, although it goes without saying that no-one is suggesting that this is the best way to communicate.
