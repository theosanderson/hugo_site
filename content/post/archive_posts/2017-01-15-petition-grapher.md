The houses of parliament in the UK host a website of petitions. When a particularly popular petition is trending it can be addictive to refresh the page and watch the numbers going up behind your eyes. But of course what one really wants is a graph.

So I built [this tool][1] which regularly queries the parliament API and stores historical petition signatures in a database which it uses to draw graphs.
