The international genetic engineered machine competition (iGEM) was my first taste of proper experimental science, and I still have a fondness for synthetic biology. I was part of the [Cambridge Team][1] for 2010. This was an exciting team project where we got to define our own genetic engineering project and work on it over a summer.

We focused on bioluminescence, building modular genetic components (BioBricks) from firefly luciferase, in a number of colours, and also from the bacterium _Vibrio fischeri_. The exciting thing about the bacterial luciferase is that this permits &#8216;autoluminescence&#8217;, i.e. the bacteria produce light without adding any other chemicals. We exploited this to light ourselves in the photo below.

In the project we achieved a Gold Medal, were finalists in the competition and won the prize for Best Wiki, which I designed. As part of the project I built [BioBrick2GenBank][2], a small tool which converts BioBricks to GenBank format for editing in standard cloning software. This has been used >350,000 times to date.

Our BioBricks have been used by a number of future teams, including by a [team from Peking][3], who used this part in one bacterium, combined with a light sensitive-system in bacteria in a separate tube, to allow cell-cell communication!

**Gibson assembly**

We were also early users of the revolutionary Gibson Assembly protocol, and I penned the lyrics to the [embarassing music-video we made to promote it][4], earning us the (dubious?) distinction of a [Craig Venter tweet][5].

**Media**

On the back of this project I was quoted in [New Scientist][6], and later by [the][7] [BBC][8].

**Book chapter**

Ben Reeve and I later wrote a [chapter][9] about the application of bioluminescence in synthetic biology.
