This exciting chart has emerged from the Maccabi study, providing evidence for efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine after the first dose.

```{r include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

data = read_csv("data_from_chart.csv")


```

As Eran Segal [pointed out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/segal_eran/status/1352696339377885187). The blue line actually includes the green line. I was interested to see what this would look like replotted as a Kaplan-Meier curve like the Pfizer graph.

```{r,fig.height=3,fig.width=8}
size_of_cohort = 50777
size_of_all_members = 480000
size_of_unvaccinated = size_of_all_members-size_of_cohort
data = data %>% mutate(new_infections_all_members = AllMembersNormalised*size_of_all_members/size_of_cohort)
data = data %>% mutate(new_infections_unvaccinated = new_infections_all_members - VaccinatedCohort)
data = data %>% mutate(daily_incidence_unvaccinated = new_infections_unvaccinated/size_of_unvaccinated)
data = data %>% mutate(daily_incidence_vaccinated = VaccinatedCohort/size_of_cohort)

graphdata = data %>% select(c(Day,contains("daily_incidence"))) %>% pivot_longer(-Day,names_to="group",values_to="daily_incidence") %>% separate(group,into=c("bla","bla2","condition"),sep="_") %>% select(-contains("bla")) %>% group_by(condition) %>% arrange(Day) %>% mutate(cumulative_incidence=cumsum(daily_incidence))

ggplot(graphdata,aes(x=Day,y=cumulative_incidence,color=condition))+geom_line()+theme_classic()+labs(caption="Caveats: based on 7-day-moving average data so sharpness of start of initial efficacy will be understated.",color="Condition",y="Cumulative Incidence")+scale_color_manual(values=c("red","blue"))+geom_point()
```


```{r include=FALSE}


#day20 = filter(graphdata, Day==22)
#day23 = filter(graphdata, Day==23)


#day23vsday20 = inner_join(day23,day20,by="condition") %>% mutate(diff=cumulative_incidence.x-cumulative_incidence.y)%>% ungroup()%>%summarise(
 # efficacy=( max(diff) - min(diff))/max(diff))






```


There are a lot of caveats about whether this is comparing like-for-like in terms of endpoint. In some respects it is definitely not, and everything is smoothed out by the 7 day moving average. In addition, this is a much older age group where we'd very much expect the immune response to take longer.

In general the top plot presented by Maccabi is much more useful for getting a sense of what is going on (what direction the lines are pointing at the end of the Kaplain-Meier plot).
